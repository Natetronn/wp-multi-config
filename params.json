{"name":"Wp Multi Config","google":"","tagline":"WP Multi Config is multi rad!","body":"> WP Multi Config allows you to run the same site in different environments with ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation ###\r\n\r\n* **Backup** your `wp-config.php` file\r\n* Place `public_html/wp-config.php` into your root directory *(edit accordingly first.)* \r\n* Place the included `config folder` above root *(can be moved if need be.)*\r\n* Edit `config/config.env.php` to include your different environment cases.\r\n* Edit a config file for each environment you plan on using *(local, dev, production and staging etc.)*\r\n\r\n### Notes ###\r\n\r\n* Tested with WP 3.4.2\r\n* Don't forget to add or change out any [Keys & Salts](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/).\r\n* WP Multi Config is meant to be used with version control via Git ([Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com) anyone?) and in cases that you have multiple environments. For example you work locally via [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html)/[WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) and push to a dev server to test changes before you later deploy to a live/production server etc.\r\n* WPMC doesn't manage syncing of your databases. Only *the connection* to each environment's DB is made. You'd probably need something like [Ramp](http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/) or similar for any kind of content syncing.\r\n\r\n### To-Do ###\r\n\r\n* Label all configs by when they became available (which version of WP this will or will not work with.)\r\n* Add more configs little by little or as needed (feel free to send in pull requests.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Change Log ###\r\n\r\n**Oct 26, 2012: 1.0.0**\r\n\r\n\tInitial Release\r\n\t\r\n#### Support ####\r\n\r\n[Github Issues](https://github.com/Natetronn/wp-multi-config/issues)\r\n\r\n[@natetronn](http://twitter.com/natetronn)","note":"Don't delete this file!
